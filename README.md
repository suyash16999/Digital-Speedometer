# Digital-Speedometer
A simple digital speedometer and odometer using PIC microcontroller

This project includes a simulation model for the above idea. In a practical situation a hall sensor can be used to calculate the speed.

While verifying the working using a simulation software, the Hall sensor is replaced with a Logic state device. During the simulation you can click on the logic state button to check if the speed and distance covered is getting updated.

The concepts of timers and interrupts in microcontrollers are involved for computing speed and distance.

## Softwares Used-

1) Proteus - Simulation Purpose

2) MPLAB IDE - C programming for PIC 16F877A
